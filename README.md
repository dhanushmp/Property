Summary

In this detailed tutorial from Nares Technologies, Mangar Raju explains the concept of properties in object-oriented programming, particularly using C#. He begins by clarifying that properties are members of a class designed to expose data (values associated with the class) to the outside world safely and effectively.

The explanation starts with the problem of accessing private fields directly from other classes. While making fields public allows free access and modification, it violates data encapsulation principles and prevents control over how fields are accessed or altered. The instructor then demonstrates traditional getter and setter methods, which provide controlled access but come with limitations such as requiring two separate methods and distinct names.

To address these issues, the concept of properties is introduced. Properties allow bundling the get and set accessors into a single construct with a clean syntax that looks like accessing a variable but actually invokes methods behind the scenes. He further emphasizes best practices such as prefixing private fields with an underscore to avoid naming conflicts with property names, making code more maintainable and readable.

The video also highlights critical benefits of properties, including the ability to add conditional logic in accessors (e.g., restricting a radius value to only increase) for enforcing business rules. This conditional logic is impossible with public variables because no code block executes during simple assignment or retrieval.

Finally, Mangar briefly discusses the three types of properties: read-only (get accessor only), write-only (set accessor only), and read-write (both get and set accessors). The key takeaway is that properties provide a flexible, controlled, and syntactically elegant way to expose and protect class data, far superior to public fields or separate getter/setter methods.

Highlights
🏷️ Properties expose class values safely to the outside world.
🔐 Private fields cannot be accessed directly, ensuring encapsulation.
🔄 Traditional getter/setter methods provide controlled access but require multiple methods with different names.
🧩 Properties combine get/set accessors into a single block with a unified name, simplifying code.
📏 Properties allow conditional logic (validation) on data assignment, which public variables cannot.
🔤 Naming convention: private fields prefixed with underscore to avoid naming collisions with properties.
📚 Properties support three access types—read-only, write-only, and read-write—offering granular control.
Key Insights

🔒 Encapsulation through Private Fields:
Declaring class variables as private is fundamental for encapsulation, protecting internal state from direct external modification. This preserves integrity and hides implementation details.

🛠️ Limitations of Public Fields:
Public fields open the door to uncontrolled access and modification, which can lead to data inconsistency and bugs. They also offer no room for validation or additional logic during get/set operations.

🎯 Getter and Setter Methods vs Properties:
While traditional getter/setter methods offer controlled access, properties streamline this approach by merging them into a single, consistent interface that reads like ordinary variable access, enhancing readability and usage.

🧠 Business Logic in Accessors:
Properties enable embedding logic inside get/set blocks, such as validation or conditional assignment (e.g., ensuring a new radius is always greater than the old one), enabling enforcement of application-specific rules seamlessly.

📝 Implicit ‘value’ Parameter in Set Accessor:
In set accessors, the new value to assign is implicitly passed as value, eliminating the need to explicitly declare parameter names in methods, simplifying syntax and reducing boilerplate code.

🔄 Naming Conventions to Avoid Collision:
Adding an underscore prefix to private fields (_radius) prevents naming conflicts with property names (Radius), making code cleaner and defining clear roles for fields versus properties.

🚦 Granular Access Control with Properties:
By defining only get or set accessors, developers can restrict access to data, creating read-only or write-only properties. This flexibility cannot be achieved with public fields, which always allow both.

This explanation provides a clear conceptual and practical understanding of properties and their advantage over public fields and traditional getter/setter methods, emphasizing their role in clean, secure, and maintainable code design.

**Second Part**
Summary

This video tutorial by Banga Raju focuses on the practical implementation of properties in object-oriented programming, specifically in the context of developing an application with a customer entity. It builds upon the conceptual explanation of properties, demonstrating how to use them to control access to private fields in a class. The video begins with defining a class named Customer with attributes such as customerID, customerName, balance, and status. It explains why direct access to these fields by making them public is problematic — mainly due to the lack of control over data modification.

The tutorial then introduces how properties provide controlled access through getter and setter methods, allowing read-only, write-only, or read-write access based on business logic. The example emphasizes the security and integrity of data, such as making customerID a read-only property to prevent unauthorized modifications. Further, the status attribute controls whether other fields such as the customer name and balance can be modified, preventing unauthorized changes when the account is inactive.

Important conditions and validations, such as preventing withdrawal beyond a minimum balance, are demonstrated using property setters to enforce these rules before value assignment. The video thoroughly discusses the differences between public variables (which allow uncontrolled access) and properties (which encapsulate logic and validation), ultimately explaining why defining properties is critical in real-life applications for maintaining data integrity and security.

Key Insights

🔑 Encapsulation and Data Protection: Properties allow encapsulation by hiding private fields and exposing controlled access. Unlike public variables that expose fields directly, properties enable logic-driven access control, which is essential for data protection in applications managing sensitive data like bank accounts.

🔄 Conditional Access via Properties: By embedding conditions inside property setters and getters (e.g., allowing balance modifications only if the account status is active), developers can efficiently enforce business rules and prevent invalid or unauthorized operations, which enhances application robustness.

🛑 Read-only Properties Enforce Immutability Where Needed: For unique identifiers such as customerID, the property is defined as read-only, preventing modifications which could corrupt the consistency of transactional data, reflecting best practices in ID management.

🧩 Simplified Interface with Complex Logic Behind the Scenes: While properties give the impression of simple attribute access, they offer the flexibility to execute complex validation logic without changing the external API. This abstraction makes code easier to maintain and extend.

💡 Difference Between Public Fields and Properties: Public fields offer no way to inject logic upon read or write, exposing all data unconditionally. Properties fill this gap by supporting encapsulated conditional logic during access and modification, making them indispensable in professional software development.

🏦 Examples Reflect Real-world Banking Constraints: The tutorial’s use of account status and minimal balance validation models real banking policies, demonstrating how software mimics real-world rules through programming constructs, ensuring realistic and practical application design.

📈 Extensibility and Future-proofing Code: The approach using properties sets the stage for future enhancements such as integrating database access or adding additional validation rules, all without disturbing existing class users, showing the maintainability advantage of properties.

This video is an excellent guide for beginners and intermediate learners who want to deepen their understanding of properties in managing object state and implementing business logic in object-oriented programming, promoting secure and maintainable code practices.
**Third one**
In this detailed tutorial on C# properties, Bangar Raju explains the concept of defining and managing properties within a class, using a Customer class as the example. This video is part three of a series focusing on properties. Initially, the video recaps what properties are, referring back to previous parts where basic properties such as CustomerID, Status, CustomerName, and Balance were introduced. The video then expands by adding three additional properties: City, State, and Country.

For the City property, Raju begins with a simple string-based property implementation but points out key challenges when restricting city values to only six predefined valid cities (Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad). He explains the problem users face when invalid input is rejected without feedback or options, likening it to a restaurant menu scenario where unavailable items cause frustration.

To solve this, he introduces the use of enum (enumeration) as a type for the city property. Enumerations provide a clear, predefined list of acceptable values that users can select from, eliminating invalid input problems and enhancing clarity. He compares this with how the Console.BackgroundColor property in C# works, using an enum to list all accepted color options, making selection easier.

The tutorial then covers how to define custom enums, emphasizing that enums are user-defined value types, similar to built-in types like int or string. By defining a Cities enum, the customer’s City property becomes strongly typed, allowing only valid city values. This method simplifies validation and improves user experience because the IDE can list available cities during assignment.

Next, the video explains how to manage access modifiers on property accessors. For example, making the property getter public but the setter protected to allow reading the property by all but restrict assignments only to child classes. Raju contrasts earlier approaches of implementing separate properties for getter and setter with the more concise C# 2.0+ capability to assign different access modifiers to accessors inside a single property.

Finally, the tutorial introduces auto-implemented properties and auto-property initializers (introduced in C# 3.0 and refined in later versions). These allow properties to be declared without explicitly declaring a private backing field, simplifying code especially when no special logic is needed in getters or setters. Raju demonstrates this with the Country property as a read-only auto-property initialized with a fixed value (e.g., “India”). The video closes by summarizing all properties defined for the Customer class and reinforcing the importance of properties in representing class attributes.

🏙️ Use of enums to restrict city property values to a predefined list improves data integrity and user experience.
⚠️ Highlighting input validation challenges when only certain values are accepted but users are not informed.
🎨 Comparison of city selection via enums to C#’s console background color property demonstrates practical use of enums.
🔒 Demonstration of different access modifiers on property getters and setters (public get, protected set) for controlled access.
🔄 Introduction to auto-implemented properties simplifies property declaration with implicit backing fields.
📈 Explanation of auto-property initializers enabling default property values without explicit constructor assignments.
💡 The tutorial ties property concepts tightly to class design, emphasizing entities’ attributes modeled as properties.
Key Insights
🏗️ Properties as fundamental class design elements: Properties represent attributes of an entity and are central to encapsulation and data access in object-oriented programming. Defining them correctly enhances maintainability and clarity.

🗺️ Restricting input using Enums enhances robustness: Using enums prevents invalid data entry by limiting the assignable values at compile time and presenting a clear selection to developers and end-users, reducing runtime errors and user frustration.

🔍 User experience matters in validation: Merely rejecting invalid values is not user-friendly. Providing users with clear options or feedback on acceptable inputs (like menus showing available items) prevents confusion and enhances system usability.

🛠️ Fine-grained accessor access control: C# allows defining different access modifiers on property get and set accessors, enabling scenarios where data can be publicly readable but only modifiable by certain classes (like child classes). This protects sensitive operations while allowing transparency.

⚙️ Auto-implemented properties improve productivity: By implicitly managing backing fields, auto-properties reduce boilerplate code, making property declarations concise when no extra customization is needed. This promotes cleaner and easier-to-read codebases.

🎯 Auto-property initializers enable constant default values: Properties can be initialized inline, making it easy to enforce fixed or default values without additional constructor code, improving code clarity and reducing errors.

🧩 Enums as new data types in C#: Enums are user-defined value types that integrate seamlessly with built-in types, allowing developers to create domain-specific types that offer strong typing and self-documenting code, thus improving code correctness and readability.

This tutorial offers a comprehensive exploration of property features in C#, combining fundamental concepts with advanced language features, practical coding styles, and user-centric design philosophy, valuable for both new and experienced developers.
